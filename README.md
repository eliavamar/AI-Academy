Welcome to AI Academy!

## Lesson 1: Basic LLM Methods

In this lesson, we will cover basic Large Language Model (LLM) methods, including:

1. Hello World - Basic interaction with LLMs
2. Structured Output - Getting formatted responses from LLMs
3. Streaming - Processing LLM outputs in real-time
4. Embeddings - Understanding vector representations of text

## Lesson 2: AI Agents - The Basics

In this lesson, we will explore AI Agents and their capabilities:

1. Trip Planner - Building an agent that can plan trips autonomously

## Prerequisites

Before starting these lessons, please ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python**: Version 3.13 or higher
   - Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Verify installation with `python --version` or `python3 --version`

2. **Virtual Environment**: Set up a Python virtual environment
   ```
   # Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Ollama**: A tool for running LLMs locally
   - Installation instructions: [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)

4. **Llama 3.1 Model**: The LLM we'll be using for our exercises
   - After installing Ollama, pull the model using the following command:
   ```
   ollama pull llama3.1
   ```

## Getting Started

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can start exploring the Jupyter notebooks in the following directories:
- "lesson 1 - basics llm methods" - For fundamental LLM techniques
- "lesson 2 - agents the basic" - For learning about AI Agents

Each lesson directory contains a README file with more detailed information about the topics covered.

Happy learning!
