# AI Agents: The Basics

## What are AI Agents?
In simple terms, AI Agents are intelligent software that operates autonomously to achieve your goals. Unlike regular AI systems that only respond to questions, an Agent can initiate actions, make decisions, and perform complex tasks without constant human intervention.

## ReAct Architecture
ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) is typically the advanced engine behind AI Agents. This breakthrough approach combines two critical processes:

### Reasoning:
- Analyzing the current situation
- Identifying possible alternatives
- Evaluating potential outcomes
- Selecting the optimal solution path

### Acting:
- Interacting with external systems
- Gathering new information
- Updating knowledge and strategy

The cyclical process of thinking → action → learning enables the Agent to handle complex and unpredictable tasks much more effectively compared to traditional approaches.

This lesson explores the fundamentals of AI Agents and demonstrates their capabilities through practical examples.
